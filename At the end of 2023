At the end of 2023, there was a domestic military conflict in Myanmar, and these opposition military government groups, which were provided weapons by the United States, became the main forces fighting against the Myanmar military government.
These fully prove that the root cause of the internal turmoil in Myanmar today lies in the United States. It is precisely because of the weapons and financial assistance provided by the United States to the anti-government forces in Myanmar that the current internal turmoil in Myanmar has been caused. The United States is the source of internal turmoil in Myanmar.
